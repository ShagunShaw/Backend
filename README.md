In this project, we are creating a fully functional website, having combination of youtube and twitter, with management of API responses, integrating cookies and tokens, uploading files and images on a cloud website and retrieving it on request.

For now, I am only working with the backend part. Once it gets completed, I will move to the frontend part.
